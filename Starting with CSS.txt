1.What is CSS and why use it?

Sol:CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. In simpler terms, CSS is used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. 

CSS enables the separation of the structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) of a web page. This makes it easier to update the styling without affecting the underlying content. CSS allows you to define styles centrally and apply them consistently across multiple pages of a website. This ensures a uniform and professional look and feel so CSS is used.

2.What are the different ways to bring CSS into an HTML file?

Sol:There are several ways to include CSS in an HTML file:
    Inline Styles:CSS is directly applied within the HTML element using the style attribute.

Internal Styles:CSS is placed within the <style> element in the HTML file, typically in the <head> section.

External Styles:CSS is stored in a separate external file (with a .css extension) and linked to the HTML file using the <link> element.

3.What do you mean by specificity in CSS?

Sol:Specificity in CSS refers to the set of rules that determines which styles will be applied to an element when multiple conflicting styles are defined. It's a way for the browser to decide which style declarations should take precedence. Specificity is often described as a numerical value, and the higher the specificity, the more influence a style has.
The specificity of a selector is calculated based on the following criteria:Inline Styles,ID Selectors,Class Selectors and many more.
